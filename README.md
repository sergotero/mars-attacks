# MARS ATTACKS

Mars Attacks is a fully JavaScript-developed game that hopes to bring back memories to all 80's and 90's kids. It's a game based on the very well-known Space Invaders, mixed with little touches of Galaxian.

### Considerations

Athough you can find the instructions for the game within the game, let me tell you some things that you might like to know before diving in:

#### Lives' system

The lives' system is quite simple. You, as the *Spacecraft*, start with 3 lives and for each of the hits you take, your defense lessens. If you reach the maximum hits allowed, you loose one life. However, as a way of helping you navigate the horrid void, immunity is granted after each hit (only for just one second).

Character | Lives | Max. hits / life
|------|-------|--------------------|
| Spacecraft | 3 | 3 |
| Red enemy | 1 | 3 |
| Purple enemy | 1 | 5 |
| Green enemy | 1 | 7 |
| Boss | 1 | 30 |

#### Boosters

There're different types of boosters. Some help you increase your score and some may restore part of your defenses or even a life.

Booster | Action | Score | 
|------|-------|---------|
|Cherry| -1 hit | - |
|Strawberry| -2 hits | - |
|Emerald| - | +50 |
|Ruby| - | +100 |
|Zaphir| - | +200 |
|Diamond| - | +300 |
|Death| -1 life | - |
|Life| +1 life | - |

#### DEMO

There's nothing more to say than... Godspeed, fellow traveler!
